In this file are described the standards of codding.
You MUST follow them, else your pull-requests will be declined.
More specific rules override more common.
In this file a word "tab" means symbol for indentation, excluding specific 
cases.

Project root directory:
	This is a special directory of project. Here you can put some special 
	files (like a license) or build/run scripts. Don't place here files 
	with code or post-build files!

Indentation:
	Tabs are allowed. Tab width must be equal 4 spaces. In such case you also 
	can use indentation by spaces, but you have to put 4 spaces instead of 
	1 tab symbol.

Line-endings:
	All text files, excluding Windows CMD and PowerShell scripts, must have a 
	UNIX line-endings format (LF). Windows CMD and PowerShell scripts must 
	have a Windows line-endings format (CR LF).

End of file:
	Each text file must be ended with a new line symbol.

.gitignore:
	Tabs are prohibited! Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.

.gitattributes:
	Tabs are prohibited! Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.

Branches:
	Use the branches to develop some new feature. Don't create a new branch 
	for a fixes - make them right on this branch and then squash the commits.

Branch naming:
	Branch names must be clear for all people and have to represent feature 
	that you are developing. Don't use such words like a "dev". Example: 
	"dev_Feature" - instead of this use "Feature".

Merges:
	All merges should be performed with a merge commit. Fast-forward merges 
	are allowed, but only for very small non-important merges, if it will not 
	hurt a project history readability. Merge commit must have a name 
	"Merge <Source branch name> into <Destination branch name> - <Main 
	change>" with a detailed change-log in a commit comment. DON'T remove a 
	merged branch!

Pull-requests:
	PRs must have a detailed change-log with description of fixes and new 
	features. Before creating PR make sure that your source branch is cleaned 
	from dirty commits, like a fixes.

Versions:
	Releases:
		Merge all scheduled changes in a "master" branch. Don't forget to 
		update the change-log file! Squash all commits since last update in a 
		one commit. This commit must have a change-log as commit comment. Tag 
		this commit with "v<Version>-Release". Push it to the remote 
		repository. Smile and be happy - Athena has a new release :)

String length:
	Length of each string must be lower than 80 characters!

Code insertions:
	If you want to put in the documentation some code, just wrap it 
	with triple tilde symbol. Right after first triple tilde in square 
	brackets you may specify the code language or interpreter. For in-line 
	code strings it will be enough to wrap the code string with tilde symbol.

################################################################

File name letter case:
	Makefiles must have "Makefile" as name in file system. (Case-sensitive)

Basic targets:
	Each Makefile must have following targets:
		"build"   - main build script;
		"clean"   - clean folder from unnecessary and post-build files;
		"all"     - all main targets;
		"re-make" - re-build project. Generally 'clean build'.
	This targets must be the first ones in Makefile right in this order!

Indentation:
	Targets must be aligned at the beginning of the line.
	Actions must have one tab more than its target.

Phony targets:
	All phony targets must be described at the start of Makefile.

Special instructions:
	In main Makefile defined several special instructions. You may them for 
	your needs. Also you may define new yours instructions in main Makefile.

Nothing to do:
	If there is nothing to do in current target, temporary make it phony and 
	put `echo "\e[1;33mNothing to <do> \e[0m"`. Use appropriate verb instead 
	of "do". Also you may use special instruction "error" to raise an error 
	for a Make, if you need it.
	Example:
		``` [Make]
		.PHONY: test
		test:
			echo "\e[1;33mNothing to test \e[0m"
			$(error)
		```
